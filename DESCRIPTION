Description: There are a few choices and patterns to building an R
    package. I have bundled these into a template to try and reflect a
    starting for my packages.  This templates aim to cover a setup with
    roxygen2 auto-documentation, testhat testing, precommit runs for code
    formating and cleaning, building and including a vignette, a package
    logo and a package website that should work on github pages.
